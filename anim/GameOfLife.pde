/* This is the Conway Game of Life in 3D.  It's a simulation of life called a cellular automation.  
 Each LED in the cube represents a potential life.  A newborn life is represented by a violet LED.  
 A life lasting more than a single generation is represented by a blue LED. A recently deceased life
 is represented by a dull red LED.  
 
 The simulation starts with some random births near the center of the cube.  The simulation 
 than proceeds with up to a maximum of 150 generations. Each new generation is based on these rules:
 1. A dead cell (LED) with exactly 4 living neighbors is born into the next generation. 
 2. A live cell with exactly 4 living neighbors continues to life to the next generation. 
 3. A cell with less than 4 or more than 4 neighbors dies in the next generation. 
 
 This version is slightly different than the one I published separately.  Since we are only 
 showing 3 generations here, I increased the number of starting live cells to insure a
 sustainable colony.  */
